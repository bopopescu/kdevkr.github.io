Amazon Corretto 8, a no-cost, multiplatform, production-ready distribution of OpenJDK, is now Generally Available (Corretto 8 had been in preview since we announced it in November, 2018). Amazon runs Corretto internally on thousands of production services. We at Amazon are committed to keeping Java free.
